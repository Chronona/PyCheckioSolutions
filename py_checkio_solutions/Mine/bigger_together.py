# Your mission here is to find a difference between the maximally positive and maximally negative numbers. Those numbers can be found by concatenating the given array of numbers.
# 
# Letâ€™s check an example. If you have numbers 1,2,3, then 321 is the maximum number, and 123 - is the minimum. The difference between those numbers is 198. But if you have numbers 4, 3 and 12 then 4312 is the maximum number, and 1234 - is the minimum. As you can see, a simple order is not what we are looking for here.
# 
# Input:A list of positive integers.
# 
# Output:An integer.
# 
# Precondition:All elements of the list can't be less than 0
# The list can't be empty
# 
#
