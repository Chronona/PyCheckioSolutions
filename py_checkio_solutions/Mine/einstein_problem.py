# The Einstein's Puzzleis a well-known logic puzzle.    It is often called Einstein's Puzzle because it is said to have been invented by Albert Einstein as a boy.    However, there is no known evidence for Einstein's or Carroll's authorship.    This puzzle can be modified with various conditions to produce a variety of similar puzzles. For starters, we will    solve a simplified version of the puzzle.
# 
# There are 5 houses on street which are painted 5 different colors:blue,green,red,whiteandyellow.
# In each house lives a person of a different nationality:Brit,Dane,German,NorwegianandSwede.
# These people drink a certain beverage:beer,coffee,milk,teaandwater.
# Smoke a certain brand of cigarettes:Rothmans,Dunhill,PallMall,WinfieldandMarlboro.
# They keep a certain pet:cat,bird,dog,fishandhorse.
# 
# None of the owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigarette, or drink the same beverage.
# 
# You are given a set of "relations". Each relation connects two identifiers in the owner relationships. For example:    "Norwegian-Dunhill" indicates that the Norwegian smokes only Dunhill. "5-dog" indicates that the owner of the 5th    house also owns a dog. Similar to Einstein's version of the problem, we will use only these types of relations.
# 
# The second argument is a question which you need to answer. The question is represented as two words separated by    dash. The first word is a characteristic of the owner while the second is a characteristic (number,    color,nationality, beverage, cigarettes or pet) you need to determine based on the first characteristic. For    example: "horse-cigarettes" asks"What the cigarettes do the owner of the horse smoke?" or "green-number" asks "What    is the street number of the green house?".
# 
# Input:Two arguments. Relations as a tuple of strings and a question as a string.
# 
# Output:The answer as a string.
# 
# How it is used:This mission teaches you something about constraint satisfaction problems within the classic context of an Einstein riddle.
# 
# Precondition:
# All questions have only one possible answer.
#
