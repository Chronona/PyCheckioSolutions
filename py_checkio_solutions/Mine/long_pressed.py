# "I Love you soooooo much! You are the best!!"
# 
# Sometimes your friends want to express their feelings in a message, and sometimes a key with a letter gets stuck    on the keyboard. In both cases we will get a "long-pressed letter" and the letter will then be printed more than once.    You are given two strings. The first string is the original text message. The second string is a printed message, which    may contain several (or possibly none) long-pressed letters. It may happen that the message was written in a hurry,    so do not forget to check that all the letters match those in the original. Return True if the printed message    matches the original one, taking into account possible long keystrokes. Or False if there are errors or no long-pressed letters.
# 
# "text" and "typed" consist of only lowercase English letters and symbols "'/?!.,;1 <= len(text), len(typed) <= 1000
